# ub-common

Common components/features for Ultimate Blocks.

## ‚ùìWhy

Since `Ultimate Blocks` is divided into two sources as `base` and `pro` versions, keeping common components and
functionality synced between those two code bases became problematic. This package provide that shared functionality
across these code bases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

`dist` folder hosts the final code to use in `Ultimate Blocks`. Delete the previous version entirely at `base`/`pro`
version of the `Ultimate Blocks` source code and paste the folder.
